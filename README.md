This repository contains the implementation code and associated data for our newly proposed metric, the Model Utilization Index (MUI). This metric is currently derived using Neuron-Based Interpretation and Sparse Activation Encoder (SAE)-based Interpretation methodologies

## üéâ News 

- [x] [2025-04-010] üéâ Exciting Release! We‚Äôve just published our paper titled "Revisiting LLM Evaluation through Mechanism Interpretability: A New Metric and Model Utility Law". Check out our repository for the corresponding analysis code!

## Brief Introduction

The Model Utilization Index (MUI) quantifies the extent to which a model leverages its capabilities to complete tasks. The core concept behind MUI is that evaluating an LLM‚Äôs overall ability involves more than just measuring its task performance; it also requires analyzing the effort expended to achieve those outcomes. Our extensive experiments reveal an inverse relationship between MUI and performance, suggesting a common trend observed in popular LLMs. We have termed this phenomenon the "Utility Law."
